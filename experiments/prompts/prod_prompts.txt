From a new insight about the internal structure and dynamics of quantum particles such as photons and electrons, a conclusion has been reached that the exact point on the detector screen of a double-slit experiment where a photon will land is completely predetermined by fine tuning the initial conditions of the photon and the electron during emission. This means that where exactly a photon lands on the detecting screen is completely predetermined by its initial conditions, just as where exactly a ball lands on the ground is predetermined by its initial conditions. This means that an interference pattern or any arbitrary pattern could be formed on the detector screen by (almost) infinitely fine-tuning the initial conditions of the photon during emission, regardless of whether one or both slits are open, regardless of the distance between the slits, regardless of the distance of the detecting screen. In principle, a mechanical version of particle interference patterns can be created by repeatedly kicking a ball towards a hole ("slit‟ ) in a wall, with a "detector‟ wall at some arbitrary distance from the hole(s). This would require almost "infinite‟ fine tuning of the initial conditions of the ball, that is initial velocity, initial direction and other parameters.
There are some unresolved paradoxes in special relativity and general relativity. This paper is an attempt to fix them all. I presented the true version of relativity. And it is shown conclusively that speed of light cannot be same with respect to source or observer. Simultaneity is absolute. Galilean invariance is indeed deep symmetry of the universe. And it applies on the speed of light too. In Michelson and Morely experiment there is simple addition of velocities with respect to source and mirror so that is why there is no fringe shift when apparatus moves with a certain velocity. In moving conductor and magnet problem, in both cases same phenomenon is involved. If the conductor is moving there is Lorentz force on the charges in the conductor. And if the magnet is moving then there is same force involved i.e. Lorentz force. Maxwell’s equations cannot be used to determine that the speed of light is constant for all inertial frames. 
General relativity isn't very easy to learn because you need to learn new concepts, new mathematics. And in addition there's some things you need to unlearn that you previously thought were obvious, for example, the concept of absolute time and Euclidean space. So these concepts, absolute time and Euclidean space, are assumed in virtually every branch of physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics. But they don't actually hold. So, for example, what do I mean by absolute time? Well, let's say that you and I come together and we synchronize our watches. Here's my watch. Here's your watch. Then we go about our day. So for example, you might decide to take a rocket ship around the moon and then back, whereas I just sit at home and read the newspaper. Well, we assume with absolute time that when we get back together at the end of the day that our clocks or our watches will still be synchronized. However, that's not the case. In general relativity, we have to abandon this notion of absolute time.
In this chapter we will develop the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics starting from Newton’s laws. These subsequent reformulations of mechanics bring with them a great deal of elegance and computational ease. But our principal interest in them stems from the fact that they are the ideal springboards from which to make the leap to quantum mechanics. The passage from the Lagrangian formulation to quantum mechanics was carried out by Feynman in his path integral formalism. A more common route to quantum mechanics, which we will follow for the most part, has as its starting point the Hamiltonian formulation, and it was discovered mainly by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, and Born. It should be emphasized, and it will soon become apparent, that all three formulations of mechanics are essentially the same theory, in that their domains of validity and predictions are identical. Nonetheless, in a given context, one or the other may be more inviting for conceptual, computational, or simply aesthetic reasons.
